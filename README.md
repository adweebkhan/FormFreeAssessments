Coding Assessments for FormFree

Assessments:
- Assessment1.cs is the first assessment
- Program.cs is the first part of the second assessment
- Assessment2P2.cs is the second part of the second assessment
- P3.cs is 

Notes:
- When running I changed the "console: " line in launch.json to "console": "integratedTerminal".
This outputs to the terminal which I thought was faster.

Comments from Adeeb Khan:
- I had a really hard time with unit tests frameworks and their paths, because of this I sadly
don't have dedicated unit tests. I have tested all the code thoroughly however.
- I apologize for the messy formatting of the git repo. I'm still new to C# and Visual Studio Code
and I'm still not completely familiar with file formats.
- My sql code has many issues because Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio kept crashing(a problem
I've run into before), so I typed out the queries to the best of my abilities without being able to properly test them.

All in all I've learned a lot. I'm proud of what I accomplished in C# with my first time. These assessments also
really opened my eyes on what I need to improve on. I'm still uncomfortable with setting custom/global paths and
need to be more comfortable using a terminal. I really appreciate this opportunity and I really hope to hear back
from you all at FormFree!
